AI-Powered UGC Ad Content System 🤳
🎯 Objective
The goal of this task was to design a structured prompt system that generates high-converting User Generated Content (UGC) ad scripts. Unlike traditional ads, UGC feels authentic, raw, and human—making it highly effective for platforms like Instagram Reels, TikTok, and YouTube Shorts.

☕ Business Case: The Daily Grind
For this task, I continued working with The Daily Grind, the specialty cafe and co-working space established in Task 1.

The Problem: Remote workers in Bangalore are tired of noisy, crowded cafes with poor Wi-Fi.

The Solution: A UGC ad campaign highlighting the "Quiet Zone" and "In-house roasting" to drive weekday foot traffic.

🧠 Prompt Engineering Logic
The prompt system in this task uses the PAS (Problem-Agitation-Solution) framework:

The Hook: Grabs attention in the first 3 seconds by addressing a relatable pain point (e.g., "I can't focus at home").

The Agitation: Highlights the frustration of typical noisy environments.

The Solution: Introduces The Daily Grind as the ultimate escape.

The CTA: A low-friction call to action (e.g., "Link in bio to book a desk").

🛠️ Tools Used
AI Engine: Google Gemini (for Script & Hook Engineering)

Visual Strategy: Designed for mobile-first platforms (Instagram/TikTok)

Documentation: GitHub
