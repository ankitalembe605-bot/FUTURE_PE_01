AI-Powered Website Copy Generator: The Daily Grind Cafe ☕
This project demonstrates a structured Prompt Engineering System designed to solve a critical problem for local businesses: unclear value propositions and generic website content.

As part of this task, I have engineered a repeatable prompt framework that generates conversion-focused copy and implemented it into a live, functional website.

📍 Business Chosen: The Daily Grind
Industry: Specialty Coffee & Co-working Space

Location: Indiranagar, Bangalore

Target Audience: Remote tech workers, digital nomads, and creatives

Unique Selling Point (USP): In-house roasted single-origin beans combined with a dedicated "Quiet Zone" for productivity

🧠 Prompt Logic & Strategy
I utilized a Role-Context-Goal framework to ensure the AI output remained professional and industry-specific:

Role Prompting: Established the AI as a "Senior Conversion Copywriter" to prioritize clarity and sales over fluff.

Context Injection: Provided specific details about the "Quiet Zone" and "In-house roasting" to avoid generic "coffee shop" text.

Constraint Engineering: Banned common "AI-isms" (e.g., tapestry, delve, unlock) to ensure a human-centric, local brand voice.

Benefit-Driven Messaging: Focused on the result (productivity and focus) rather than just the product (caffeine).

🛠️ Tools Used
AI Engine: Google Gemini (for Copy Engineering)

Web Builder: Lovable.dev (for React-based site implementation)

Documentation: GitHub

📂 Repository Structure
prompts/: Contains the master system prompt used to generate the copy.

output/: Contains the final AI-generated content set (Homepage, Services, CTAs).

site-demo/: Includes screenshots of the live implementation and the deployment link.

🚀 Key Deliverables (As seen on site)
1. Homepage Hero
Headline: "Brewed for Focus. Crafted for Flavor."

Sub-headline: "Bangalore's premier spot for house-roasted specialty coffee and a workspace that actually helps you get things done."

2. Tailored Services
The Quiet Zone: High-speed Wi-Fi, standing desks, and private meeting pods.

Signature Brews: Single-origin beans roasted in-house weekly.

Event Hosting: Networking nights and workshops for creatives.

3. High-Intent CTAs
Direct: [Order Now]

Booking: [Book a Spot] (linked to the Quiet Zone)

📈 Impact
This system reduces the cost of professional copywriting for local business owners while significantly improving website clarity. By highlighting the Quiet Zone, the copy is specifically engineered to drive foot traffic during low-peak weekday hours.
