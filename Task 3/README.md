# AI-Driven SEO Content Cluster Generator 🚀

This repository contains a professional **SEO Prompt System** designed to scale content production for local businesses. It moves beyond simple article generation by using a **Pillar & Cluster model** to build topical authority and rank for local search terms.

## 🎯 Project Objective
To demonstrate a reproducible workflow that generates:
1.  **High-Authority Pillar Content:** Comprehensive guides that target primary, high-volume keywords.
2.  **Semantic Content Clusters:** Supporting articles that answer long-tail queries and boost internal linking.
3.  **Local SEO Optimization:** Natural integration of "City + Service" keywords to capture local intent.
4.  **Conversion-Focused Copy:** Content designed to turn readers into leads.
