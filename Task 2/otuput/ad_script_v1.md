| **[0:00-0:03]** Aesthetic handheld shot of latte art being poured in slow motion. | **(Hook)** POV: You finally found the only quiet corner in the city with actually good coffee. |
| **[0:03-0:10]** Quick, "messy" cuts: A kitchen table covered in laundry, a laptop balanced on a pile of books. | **(Problem)** I love working from home, but let’s be real... the 'home' part is a total productivity killer. |
| **[0:10-0:18]** Handheld footage of a crowded chain cafe: loud music, people bumping the table, no outlets. | **(Agitation)** And the big chains are just as bad. It’s loud, it’s cramped, and finding an outlet is like winning the lottery. |
| **[0:18-0:25]** Wide, cozy shot of The Daily Grind's interior. Close up of a laptop plugged in next to a steaming latte. | **(Solution)** Then I found The Daily Grind. It’s got fast Wi-Fi, plenty of plugs, and the vibe is actually... peaceful. |
| **[0:25-0:30]** Creator taking a sip of coffee and smiling at the camera. Text overlay: 'Link in Bio' | **(CTA)** If you need a serious reset, come say hi. I’ll be the one in the corner booth. See you there. |
