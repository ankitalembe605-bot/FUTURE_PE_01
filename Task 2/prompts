# 🤖 AI Prompt Engineering Logic

This project utilizes a **Multi-Step Prompting Strategy** to move from high-level brand strategy to platform-ready UGC (User-Generated Content) scripts. 

---

## 1. System Persona Prompt
**Purpose:** Sets the AI's "brain" to think like a Performance Creative Director rather than a generic assistant.

> **Prompt:**
> "You are an expert UGC (User-Generated Content) Creative Strategist. Your goal is to create high-converting ad content for a local cafe called 'The Daily Grind'. 
> Your tone should be: Authentic, relatable, slightly aesthetic, and community-focused. 
> Avoid: Corporate jargon, 'salesy' language, and over-polished marketing speak. 
> Framework: Use the PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solution) model for all scripts."

## 2. The Hook Matrix Prompt
**Purpose:** Generates "Scroll-Stopping" openings based on psychological triggers.

> **Prompt:**
> "Generate 5 distinct hooks for a 15-second TikTok/Reel for the cafe. 
> Categorize them by:
> - **The POV:** (e.g., 'POV: You found...')
> - **The Hot Take:** (e.g., 'Stop going to [Competitor] for...')
> - **The Visual Tease:** (e.g., 'I can't believe this spot exists...')
> - **The Utility:** (e.g., '3 reasons why this is the best remote work spot...')
> - **The Secret:** (e.g., 'Ordering the off-menu item at...') "

## 3. The PAS Scripting Prompt (With Visual Cues)
**Purpose:** Turns a hook into a full narrative with directions for the creator.

> **Prompt:**
> "Write a 30-second UGC script using the 'POV' hook. 
> Format the output as a table with two columns: [Visual Scene] and [Audio/Voiceover].
> Ensure the script addresses the 'Problem' (distracted working at home), the 'Agitation' (loud chain coffee shops), and the 'Solution' (The Daily Grind's cozy atmosphere and fast Wi-Fi)."

---

## 4. Platform-Specific Adaptation Prompt
**Purpose:** Modifies the output for different technical constraints (YouTube Shorts vs. Instagram).

> **Prompt:**
> "Take the previous script and adapt it for YouTube Shorts. 
> Requirements:
> 1. Shorten the intro to 1.5 seconds.
> 2. Add a 'Loop' ending where the last sentence leads back into the first sentence.
> 3. Suggest 3 trending audio 'vibes' (e.g., Lo-fi, Upbeat Jazz, Ambient Cafe Sounds)."

---

## 5. Metadata & Conversion Prompt
**Purpose:** Generates the 'Final Inch' content—captions and CTAs.

> **Prompt:**
> "Generate 3 captions for the video:
> - Option 1: Short, emoji-heavy, and 'Gen-Z' coded.
> - Option 2: Detailed with a 'Micro-blog' feel.
> - Option 3: Direct Response (DR) focused with a clear discount code/offer.
> Include a list of 5 niche hashtags for local coffee lovers."
